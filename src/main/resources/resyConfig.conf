# ReservationDetails #
######################
# The date you want to make the reservation in YYYY-MM-DD format. This should be set to the day after the
# last available day with restaurant reservations as this is the day you want to snipe for a reservation once they
# become available.
# e.g.
# resDetails.date="2099-01-30"
resDetails.date=
# Size of the party reservation
# e.g.
# resDetails.party-size=2
resDetails.party-size=
# The unique identifier of the restaurant you want to make the reservation at. Can be found when viewing
# available reservations for a restaurant as a query parameter in the `/find` API call if you have the web console open.
# e.g.
# resDetails.venue-id=123
resDetails.venue-id=
# Priority list of reservation times and table types. Time is in military time HH:MM:SS format. This
# allows full flexibility on your reservation preferences. For example, your priority order of reservations can be...
#   * 18:00 - Dining Room
#   * 18:00 - Patio
#   * 18:15
#   If you have no preference on table type, then simply don't set it and the bot will pick a reservation for that time
#   slot regardless of the table type.
# e.g.
# resDetails.res-time-types=[
#     {reservation-time="18:00:00", table-type="Dining Room"},
#     {reservation-time="18:00:00", table-type="Patio"},
#     {reservation-time="18:15:00"}

# Minute of the day when reservations become available and when you want to snipe

# snipeTime.minutes=0

################
# RetryPolicy #
# The bot will retry to make a reservation if it fails. This policy defines how many times the bot will retry
# and how long it will wait between retries.
# e.g.
# retryPolicy.max-retries=5
# retryPolicy.retry-interval=5 # for 5 seconds
retryPolicy.max-retries=10

################
# ProxyConfig #
# The bot will use a proxy to make the reservation. This policy defines the proxy configuration.
# e.g.
# proxyConfig.enabled=true
# proxyConfig.proxy-host="localhost"
# proxyConfig.proxy-port=8080
# you can get proxy addresses from https://www.proxynova.com/proxy-server-list/elite-proxies/
